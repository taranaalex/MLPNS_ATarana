The purpose of this plot is to compare the evolution with time (in seconds) of the absorbance (an adimensional quantity) of a solution of CuSO4 and H2O (at a fixed wavelenght of lambda=810 nm) with the prevision given by a particular theoretical model for diffusion (Fick's equation). The black curve represents the measured values of A, while the colored curves are the ones predicted by the model with 4 different values of the parameter "diffusion coefficient D".

In the first plot there was a lot of exceeding white space that has been removed (the axis hve been shifted). The colors of the curves were changed as well, in order to improve color blindness accessibility.
